# html-bootstrap-editor-showcase
Showcase templates for use with HTML Bootstrap editor.


## How to create your own showcase
We use GitHub Actions to generate our showcase and upload it to GitHub Sites. To do this yourself, you can fork the project and then go to your project settings. In the 'Pages' section, configure the name of your page. Once that's done, you can commit a new template and the GitHub page will be generated automatically.
